Below are a bunch of small projects that I made to play around with real data. They are based on a combination of interest in the topics and the joy of playing with technology.
The data come from publicly available sources like the Federal Statistical Office, Wikipedia, or NGO Abgeordnetenwatch.de.
Mine has been the idea to implement these visualizations.
